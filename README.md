 Background
I (@malefficient) have been an on-again off-again user of the [Obsidian.md](https://obsidian.md/) note-taking taking tool since 2020.

I have downloaded, tinkered with, and extended a variety of other peoples 'starter-vaults', But I still felt like I was missing something.

I had a lot of experience watching people use their own setup, but i never really gained much perspective on __how__ they got there.

So I decided to do the obvious.

Create an empty vault, commit it to github, and pair it with a running narrative.
