# build-a-vault
Follow along and watch as I build a vault from scratch in Obsidian.md v1.4+

# Background
I (@malefficient) have been an on-again off-again user of the [Obsidian.md](https://obsidian.md/) note-taking taking tool since 2020

During that time I have started, stopped, forgot about (and obviously come back to) Obsidian several times.
In the past few months I have consumed a lot of great obsidian content. 
(Much of it from [@nicolevdh](https://www.youtube.com/@nicolevdh)). 

I have also downloaded, tinkered with, and extended a variety of other peoples 'starter-vaults' (more on these later). But I still felt like I was missing something.
And then it occured to me. 

Despite watching all these people *use* their own obsidian vaults, it felt like I was basically peeking over their shoulder to watch them use their current (highly optimized) setup without any sense of context on *how they got there* over time. So i decided to do the obvious.

# Starting over 
Create a vault from scratch, track it in github, and let anyone who cares to follow along. Learning-out-loud

# Build your own vault

```
user@localhost: git clone https://github.com/sealablab/build_a_vault
```
